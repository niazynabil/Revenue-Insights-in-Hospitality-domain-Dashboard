# Revenue-Insights-in-Hospitality-domain-Dashboard
## Overview
Atliq Grands, a hospitality company, noticed a loss in their market share and revenue over a few months. To understand the cause of this loss, they needed a way to analyze the data. We created a dashboard in Power BI using three months of data to show Revenue | RevPAR-Revenue per available room | DSRN - Daily sellable room nights | ADR - Average Daily Rate | DBRN - Daily Booked Room Nights | DURN - Daily Utilized Room Nights| Realisation % |Occupancy % ,  with many types of visualizations such as revenue by category, trends by key metric, realization and ADR by booking platform and table to show property by key metric.

With the created dashboard, the Revenue team of Atliq Grand were able to gain insights about their revenue trend. This could help in regaining their revenue and market share by 20% in the next month.
